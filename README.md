Machine Learning Assignment on Feature Extraction
# CIFAR-10 Feature Extraction & Classification

## Overview
This project explores **feature extraction** techniques for the CIFAR-10 dataset using both traditional methods (HOG, LBP, Edge Detection) and deep learning (CNN, ResNet). The extracted features are then used for **classification** using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

## Installation
